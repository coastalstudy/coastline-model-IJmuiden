# Simple model for predicting coastline evolution due to wave climate

This type of "one-line" model has been widely found in literature. Here the problem example is for IJmuiden harbour in the Netherlands. The example is described in Roelvink and Reniers' book *A guide to modeling coastal morphology* (World Scientific, 2011).

The code is originally from code.google.com/p/coastline-model-ijmuiden
