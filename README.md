# Simple model for predicting coastline evolution due to wave climate

This type of "one-line" model has been widely found in literature. Here the problem example is for IJmuiden harbour in the Netherlands. The example is described in Roelvink and Reniers' book *A guide to modeling coastal morphology* (World Scientific, 2011).

The Lua script can be run from the terminal:

```bash
$ lua coastlinemodel.lua
```

The code is aimed at students in civil/environmental engineering branches, therefore code and data is squeezed in one file (which is very different from recommendations for computer science practice).

Part of comments are written in Vietnamese to facilitate Vietnamese students.

The code is originally from code.google.com/p/coastline-model-ijmuiden
